This README provides a brief overview of stacks and queues, two fundamental data structures used in computer science.
Stacks:
Definition: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
Operations:
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
Peek: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
Common Applications:
Function call stack in programming languages.
Undo mechanisms in text editors and software applications.
Implementation:
Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
Complexity:
Time complexity for push, pop, and peek operations: O(1).
Queues:
Definition: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
Operations:
Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes and returns the front element from the queue.
Peek: Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.
Common Applications:
Task scheduling in operating systems.
Print queue management.
Implementation:
Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
Complexity:
Time complexity for enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations: O(1).
Must-Knows:
Understand the basic principles of LIFO (Stacks) and FIFO (Queues).
Recognize the common operations associated with stacks and queues: push, pop, peek (stacks); enqueue, dequeue, peek (queues).
Choose the appropriate data structure based on the requirements of your application.
Be aware of the various applications where stacks and queues are used, as this knowledge helps in problem-solving and system design.
